Phylogenies (evolutionary trees) have provided key insights into the international spread of SARS-CoV-2 and enabled investigation of individual outbreaks and transmission chains in specific settings. Phylodynamic approaches combine evolutionary, demographic and epidemiological concepts and have helped track virus genetic changes, identify emerging variants and inform public health strategy. Here, we review and synthesize studies that illustrate how phylogenetic and phylodynamic techniques were applied during the first year of the pandemic, and summarize their contributions to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control.},

              (SARS-CoV-2) exhibited a major step change in its adaptation to
              humans. These highly mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2 had enhanced
              rates of transmission relative to previous variants and were
              termed 'variants of concern' (VOCs). Designated Alpha, Beta,
              Gamma, Delta and Omicron, the VOCs emerged independently from one
              another, and in turn each rapidly became dominant, regionally or
              globally, outcompeting previous variants. The success of each VOC
              relative to the previously dominant variant was enabled by
              altered intrinsic functional properties of the virus and, to
              various degrees, changes to virus antigenicity conferring the
              ability to evade a primed immune response. The increased virus
              fitness associated with VOCs is the result of a complex interplay
              of virus biology in the context of changing human immunity due to
              both vaccination and prior infection. In this Review, we

              hope of uncovering the genetic determinants of complex disease.
              We describe a computationally efficient method for inferring
              genealogies from population genotype data and show how these
              genealogies can be used to fine map disease loci and interpret
              association signals. These genealogies take the form of the
              ancestral recombination graph (ARG). The ARG defines a
              genealogical tree for each locus, and, as one moves along the
              chromosome, the topologies of consecutive trees shift according
              to the impact of historical recombination events. There are two
              stages to our analysis. First, we infer plausible ARGs, using a
              heuristic algorithm, which can handle unphased and missing data
              and is fast enough to be applied to large-scale studies. Second,
              we test the genealogical tree at each locus for a clustering of
              the disease cases beneath a branch, suggesting that a causative
              mutation occurred on that branch. Since the true ARG is unknown,
              we average this analysis over an ensemble of inferred ARGs. We
              have characterized the performance of our method across a wide
              range of simulated disease models. Compared with simpler tests,
              our method gives increased accuracy in positioning untyped
              causative loci and can also be used to estimate the frequencies

              individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
              breeding models, population structure and demography. This
              approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
              tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those
              loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral
              variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a
              succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package
              msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed
              afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires
              storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal
              of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem
              by providing an algorithm to quickly 'simplify' a tree sequence
              by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes.
              By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the
              extant population, we show that the total storage space required
              is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over
              classical forward-time simulations. We implement a
              general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying
              genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any
              population model more efficient. We modify two popular
              forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and
              observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of
              one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method
              for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal
              genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather
              than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M
              polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making
              it feasible to store a simulation's entire final generation as
              well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized
              with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The

              genomes to trace local transmission dynamics. However, because
              the viral phylogeny is already so large-and will undoubtedly grow
              many fold-placing new sequences onto the tree has emerged as a

              they evolve. It is apparent, both from controlled experiments and
              in genome sequences sampled from nature, that patterns of
              recombination in coronaviruses are non-random and that this is
              likely attributable to a combination of sequence features that
              favour the occurrence of recombination break points at specific
              genomic sites, and selection disfavouring the survival of
              recombinants within which favourable intra-genome interactions
              have been disrupted. Here we leverage available whole-genome
              sequence data for six coronavirus subgenera to identify specific
              patterns of recombination that are conserved between multiple
              subgenera and then identify the likely factors that underlie
              these conserved patterns. Specifically, we confirm the
              non-randomness of recombination break points across all six
              tested coronavirus subgenera, locate conserved recombination hot-
              and cold-spots, and determine that the locations of
              transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major
              determinants of conserved recombination break-point hotspot
              locations. We find that while the locations of recombination
              break points are not uniformly associated with degrees of
              nucleotide sequence conservation, they display significant
              tendencies in multiple coronavirus subgenera to occur in low
              guanine-cytosine content genome regions, in non-coding regions,
              at the edges of genes, and at sites within the Spike gene that
              are predicted to be minimally disruptive of Spike protein
              folding. While it is apparent that sequence features such as
              transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major
              determinants of where the template-switching events that yield
              recombination break points most commonly occur, it is evident
              that selection against misfolded recombinant proteins also

              The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made
              from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even
              though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or
              does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and
              direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring
              recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct
              the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the
              coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the
              length of terminal branches and the total branch length are

              resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing

              patterns of LD directly to the underlying recombination process;

              genotypes in a sample of individuals using a reference panel of
              haplotypes. In the last 10 years reference panels have increased
              in size by more than 100 fold. Increasing reference panel size
              improves accuracy of markers with low minor allele frequencies
              but poses ever increasing computational challenges for imputation
              methods. Here we present IMPUTE5, a genotype imputation method
              that can scale to reference panels with millions of samples. This
              method continues to refine the observation made in the IMPUTE2
              method, that accuracy is optimized via use of a custom subset of
              haplotypes when imputing each individual. It achieves fast,
              accurate, and memory-efficient imputation by selecting haplotypes
              using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform (PBWT). By using
              the PBWT data structure at genotyped markers, IMPUTE5 identifies
              locally best matching haplotypes and long identical by state
              segments. The method then uses the selected haplotypes as
              conditioning states within the IMPUTE model. Using the HRC
              reference panel, which has ∼65,000 haplotypes, we show that
              IMPUTE5 is up to 30x faster than MINIMAC4 and up to 3x faster
              than BEAGLE5.1, and uses less memory than both these methods.
              Using simulated reference panels we show that IMPUTE5 scales
              sub-linearly with reference panel size. For example, keeping the
              number of imputed markers constant, increasing the reference
              panel size from 10,000 to 1 million haplotypes requires less than
              twice the computation time. As the reference panel increases in
              size IMPUTE5 is able to utilize a smaller number of reference
              haplotypes, thus reducing computational cost.",

              as a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference using
              Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. With this note, we
              announce the release of version 3.2, a major upgrade to the
              latest official release presented in 2003. The new version
              provides convergence diagnostics and allows multiple analyses to
              be run in parallel with convergence progress monitored on the
              fly. The introduction of new proposals and automatic optimization
              of tuning parameters has improved convergence for many problems.
              The new version also sports significantly faster likelihood
              calculations through streaming single-instruction-multiple-data
              extensions (SSE) and support of the BEAGLE library, allowing
              likelihood calculations to be delegated to graphics processing
              units (GPUs) on compatible hardware. Speedup factors range from
              around 2 with SSE code to more than 50 with BEAGLE for codon
              problems. Checkpointing across all models allows long runs to be
              completed even when an analysis is prematurely terminated. New
              models include relaxed clocks, dating, model averaging across
              time-reversible substitution models, and support for hard,
              negative, and partial (backbone) tree constraints. Inference of
              species trees from gene trees is supported by full incorporation
              of the Bayesian estimation of species trees (BEST) algorithms.
              Marginal model likelihoods for Bayes factor tests can be
              estimated accurately across the entire model space using the
              stepping stone method. The new version provides more output
              options than previously, including samples of ancestral states,
              site rates, site d(N)/d(S) rations, branch rates, and node dates.

              of China, in December of 2019. All current members of the family
              Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental
              adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational
              events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA
              sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists
              is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated
              SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat
              coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan
              province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several
              recombination events have since occurred from other divergent
              bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance
              between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor
              binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor
              lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to
              SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient
              endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein
              responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper
              demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational
              events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide ``breakpoint
              sequences'', similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination
              naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries
              between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This

  abstract = "The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity
              of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates
              fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a
              new approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which
              clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is
              a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and
              branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an
              initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies
              this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to
              this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths,
              only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used
              extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the
              topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as
              that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher
              than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches.
              The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with
              other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood
              maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min
              were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data
              set consisting of 500 rbcL sequences with 1,428 base pairs from

  abstract = "The complex correlation structure of a collection of orthologous
              DNA sequences is uniquely captured by the ``ancestral
              recombination graph'' (ARG), a complete record of coalescence and
              recombination events in the history of the sample. However,
              existing methods for ARG inference are computationally intensive,
              highly approximate, or limited to small numbers of sequences,
              and, as a consequence, explicit ARG inference is rarely used in
              applied population genomics. Here, we introduce a new algorithm
              for ARG inference that is efficient enough to apply to dozens of
              complete mammalian genomes. The key idea of our approach is to
              sample an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes conditional on
              an ARG of [Formula: see text] chromosomes, an operation we call
              ``threading.'' Using techniques based on hidden Markov models, we
              can perform this threading operation exactly, up to the
              assumptions of the sequentially Markov coalescent and a
              discretization of time. An extension allows for threading of
              subtrees instead of individual sequences. Repeated application of
              these threading operations results in highly efficient Markov
              chain Monte Carlo samplers for ARGs. We have implemented these
              methods in a computer program called ARGweaver. Experiments with
              simulated data indicate that ARGweaver converges rapidly to the
              posterior distribution over ARGs and is effective in recovering
              various features of the ARG for dozens of sequences generated
              under realistic parameters for human populations. In applications
              of ARGweaver to 54 human genome sequences from Complete Genomics,
              we find clear signatures of natural selection, including regions
              of unusually ancient ancestry associated with balancing selection
              and reductions in allele age in sites under directional
              selection. The patterns we observe near protein-coding genes are
              consistent with a primary influence from background selection
              rather than hitchhiking, although we cannot rule out a
              contribution from recurrent selective sweeps.",

  abstract = "Maximum-likelihood methods based on models of codon substitution
              accounting for heterogeneous selective pressures across sites
              have proved to be powerful in detecting positive selection in
              protein-coding DNA sequences. Those methods are phylogeny based
              and do not account for the effects of recombination. When
              recombination occurs, such as in population data, no unique tree
              topology can describe the evolutionary history of the whole
              sequence. This violation of assumptions raises serious concerns
              about the likelihood method for detecting positive selection.
              Here we use computer simulation to evaluate the reliability of
              the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for positive selection in the
              presence of recombination. We examine three tests based on
              different models of variable selective pressures among sites.
              Sequences are simulated using a coalescent model with
              recombination and analyzed using codon-based likelihood models
              ignoring recombination. We find that the LRT is robust to low
              levels of recombination (with fewer than three recombination
              events in the history of a sample of 10 sequences). However, at
              higher levels of recombination, the type I error rate can be as
              high as 90\%, especially when the null model in the LRT is
              unrealistic, and the test often mistakes recombination as
              evidence for positive selection. The test that compares the more
              realistic models M7 (beta) against M8 (beta and omega) is more
              robust to recombination, where the null model M7 allows the
              positive selection pressure to vary between 0 and 1 (and so does
              not account for positive selection), and the alternative model M8
              allows an additional discrete class with omega = d(N)/d(S) that
              could be estimated to be >1 (and thus accounts for positive
              selection). Identification of sites under positive selection by
              the empirical Bayes method appears to be less affected than the
              LRT by recombination.",

              reference panel that is available because the number of
              accurately imputed variants increases with reference panel size.
              However, one impediment to using larger reference panels is the
              increased computational cost of imputation. We present a new
              genotype imputation method, Beagle 5.0, which greatly reduces the
              computational cost of imputation from large reference panels. We
              compare Beagle 5.0 with Beagle 4.1, Impute4, Minimac3, and
              Minimac4 using 1000 Genomes Project data, Haplotype Reference

               during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, we reveal the spectrum of
               SARS-CoV-2 mutations. Unlike those of other viruses, the
               mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits extreme asymmetry,
               with a much higher rate of C>U than U>C substitutions, as well
               as a higher rate of G>U than U>G substitutions. This suggests
               directional genome sequence evolution during transmission. The
               substantial asymmetry and directionality of the mutational
               spectrum enable pseudotemporal tracing of SARS-CoV-2 without
               prior information about the root sequence, collection time, and
               sampling region. This shows that the viral genome sequences
               collected in Asia are similar to the original genome sequence.
               Adjusted estimation of the dN/dS ratio accounting for the
               asymmetrical mutational spectrum also shows evidence of negative

               findings provide deep insights into the mutational processes in
               SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and advance the understanding of the

               genetic material of >350,000 samples of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
               responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed details of
               the spectrum of mutations occurring in the recent viral
               transmission. The analysis was performed by researchers in South
               Korea and the UK, led by Young Seok Ju at the Korea Advanced
               Institute for Science and Technology, Daejeon. The results
               confirm that mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are being shaped
               in a specific pattern: the nucleic acid bases cytosine and
               guanine have been replaced by uracil much more often than its
               reverse. Overall, the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet
               reached equilibrium, suggesting that the virus entered the human
               population very recently and is currently evolving rapidly. The

    abstract = "{Novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, often originate from recombination events. The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3,509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently colocated with TRS-B sites than expected.}",

@article{Gallaher2020-mr,
	abstract = {Much remains unknown concerning the origin of the novel pandemic coronavirus that has raged across the globe since emerging in Wuhan of Hubei province, near the center of the People's Republic of China, in December of 2019. All current members of the family Coronaviridae have arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide ``breakpoint sequences'', similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This ``breakpoint sequence hypothesis''provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.},
