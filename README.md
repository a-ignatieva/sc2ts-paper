# sc2ts-paper

This is the repository for the code that produces analysis and figures in the preprint _Towards Pandemic-Scale Ancestral Recombination Graphs of SARS-CoV-2_ (https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.08.544212). See our _virological.org_ post at https://virological.org/t/towards-pandemic-scale-ancestral-recombination-graphs-of-sars-cov-2/936 for a brief summary. To obtain the code specifically used in that version of the preprint, checkout the code associated with the [`preprint-v1` tag](https://github.com/jeromekelleher/sc2ts-paper/releases/tag/preprint-v1).

The main `sc2ts` software itself exists in a separate repository: https://github.com/jeromekelleher/sc2ts

Jupyter notebooks to perform the analysis of the "Wide" and "Long" ARGs described in the preprint are present in
the `notebooks` directory.

The Wide and Long ARGs themselves, in compressed tskit format, which are required for most of the analysis, are subject to GISAID distribution conditions, hence we have not placed them online. They are available by request from the authors.
